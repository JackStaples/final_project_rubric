# final_demo_rubric

Here we will construct a rubric for both the final presentation and final project functionality. You input is critical.

The final demo is worth 10% and the code functionality is worth 15%.

You may share ideas by

- creating Github Issues to foster discussion of portions of the mark
- creating Pull requests on the markdown files for the functionality and demo

Things to think about are

- what functionality is reasonable to have completed by April 7th?
- what should each component be worth

In general, be as specific as you can for what you think will be a fair evaluation of your project
